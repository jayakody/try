# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Which Programming Language Should I start
It's completely up to you. We've given three very popular options here
#### Getting Started with Python
```python
yum install python
```
#### Starting with Ansible
```ansible
yum install ansible
```
After the installation you can perform a login function to the appropriate big switch controller.
```shell
yum install ansible-second-steps
```
> **Note:** `login_controller.py` Might fail due to authentication issues. You can always spin out a new controller using  [labs.bigswitch.com](https://labs.bigswitch.com).
